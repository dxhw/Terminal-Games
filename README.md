# Terminal-Games

This repository includes games played in the terminal using python3.

The programs are:
* typer.py: A speed typing test
* substrings.py: A bomb-party-like [(jklm.fun)](jklm.fun) game where you type words including substrings
* lsat_test.py: An LSAT practice program for the logical reasoning and reading comprehension sections
* minesweeper.py: Minesweeper mimicking most of the functionality of [(minesweeperonline.com)](minesweeperonline.com)

Dataset Sources:
* Typer: [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)
* Substrings: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words
* LSAT Practice: https://github.com/zhongwanjun/AR-LSAT

Necessary packages:
* Typer: curses
* Substrings: curses
* LSAT Practice: curses
* Minesweeper: pygame, argparse

All games use match, case keywords, so they require python 3.10 at least

Have fun!
